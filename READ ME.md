Originally I thought that I would be able to use a mk character and ironman looking robots for enemies.
I didn't consider obviously at the time that those characters are copy righted. So one change is the use of random free art I found on opengameart.org and the free unity section. As you can probably see sadly my project is not finnished. The scale that I wanted this project to be was too much in the time frame. I thought I could do it but every step of the way I ran into bugs and issues that cost me hours. For example trying to get the enemys on the spline took me 12 hours to figure out why theyre dropping off the spline. this is how it currently is with the bullets shooting on the z axis and the muzzle flash not dissapearing. I will continue to work on it in hopes of completeing it.
